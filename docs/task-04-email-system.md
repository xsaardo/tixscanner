- [ ] User preference management:
  - [ ] HTML vs plain text preference
  - [ ] Chart types and styles
  - [ ] Email frequency (immediate, hourly, daily)
  - [ ] Opt-out mechanisms

## Testing Criteria
- [ ] Gmail SMTP connection works correctly
- [ ] Price charts generate without errors
- [ ] HTML emails render properly in major clients
- [ ] Images are embedded correctly in emails
- [ ] Price alert emails are sent immediately
- [ ] Daily summaries are formatted correctly
- [ ] Email delivery is logged accurately
- [ ] Failed emails are retried appropriately

## Files to Create
- `src/email_client.py` - Gmail SMTP client
- `src/chart_generator.py` - Matplotlib chart creation
- `src/email_templates.py` - HTML/text templates
- `templates/price_alert.html` - Alert email template
- `templates/daily_summary.html` - Summary email template
- `tests/test_email_system.py` - Email system tests
- `tests/test_chart_generator.py` - Chart generation tests

## Dependencies
- Task 1: Project Setup (for configuration)
- Task 2: Database Schema (for price history data)
- `matplotlib` library
- **Security Dependencies (choose one approach):**
  - **OAuth2 Gmail API**: `google-api-python-client`, `google-auth-httplib2`, `google-auth-oauthlib`
  - **Alternative Services**: `sendgrid`, `mailgun2`, or `boto3` (for AWS SES)
- `smtplib` (built-in, if using SMTP)
- `email.mime` (built-in)

## Estimated Time
5-7 hours

## Security Notes
- **NEVER use App Passwords** - Google is phasing them out and they're less secure
- **Recommended: OAuth2 with Gmail API** - Most secure, no password storage needed
- **Alternative: Third-party services** - Often easier to set up and more reliable
- **If using SMTP**: Only with OAuth2 authentication, never with passwords

## Implementation Notes  
- Test email rendering across different clients (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail)
- Keep embedded images under 500KB each for deliverability
- Implement proper error handling for API/SMTP failures
- Consider email rate limits:
  - Gmail API: 250 quota units per user per second
  - SendGrid: Varies by plan (100 emails/day free tier)
  - Mailgun: 5,000 emails/month free tier
- Include unsubscribe options even for personal use
- Store OAuth2 refresh tokens securely (encrypted or in secure credential store)

## Chart Specifications
```python
# Chart dimensions and styling
CHART_WIDTH = 800
CHART_HEIGHT = 400
DPI = 150
COLORS = ['#1f77b4', '#ff7f0e', '#2ca02c', '#d62728']
```

from src.email_client import EmailClient
from src.chart_generator import generate_price_chart

# Send price alert (OAuth2 Gmail API)
email_client = EmailClient(provider='gmail_api')
chart_path = generate_price_chart("123456789", days=7)
email_client.send_price_alert("123456789", 200.0, 150.0, chart_path)

# Send price alert (SendGrid)
email_client = EmailClient(provider='sendgrid')
email_client.send_price_alert("123456789", 200.0, 150.0, chart_path)

# Send daily summary
