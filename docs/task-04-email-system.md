  - [ ] Calculate percentage price drop
  - [ ] Include current vs threshold price comparison
  - [ ] Embed relevant price chart
  - [ ] Add direct purchase link
- [ ] Alert email content:
  - [ ] Clear subject line with price drop amount
  - [ ] Concert name and venue information
  - [ ] Price change details and percentages
  - [ ] Trend chart showing recent price history
  - [ ] Call-to-action button for purchasing

### 5. Daily Summary Emails
- [ ] Implement daily price summary:
  - [ ] `send_daily_summary()`
  - [ ] Aggregate all tracked concerts
  - [ ] Show price changes from previous day
  - [ ] Include 7-day trend charts for each concert
  - [ ] Highlight concerts near threshold prices
- [ ] Summary email content:

  - [ ] Priority handling (alerts vs summaries)
- [ ] Delivery tracking:
  - [ ] Log all email attempts
  - [ ] Track delivery success/failure rates
  - [ ] Monitor bounce rates
  - [ ] Error reporting and alerting

### 8. Configuration Integration
- [ ] Email configuration options:
  - [ ] Recipient email address
  - [ ] Sender name and email
  - [ ] Email frequency settings
  - [ ] Chart preferences
  - [ ] Template customization options
- [ ] User preference management:
  - [ ] HTML vs plain text preference
  - [ ] Chart types and styles
  - [ ] Email frequency (immediate, hourly, daily)
  - [ ] Opt-out mechanisms

## Testing Criteria
- [ ] Gmail SMTP connection works correctly
- [ ] Price charts generate without errors
- [ ] HTML emails render properly in major clients
- [ ] Images are embedded correctly in emails
- [ ] Price alert emails are sent immediately
- [ ] Daily summaries are formatted correctly
- [ ] Email delivery is logged accurately
- [ ] Failed emails are retried appropriately

## Files to Create
- `src/email_client.py` - Gmail SMTP client
- `src/chart_generator.py` - Matplotlib chart creation
- `src/email_templates.py` - HTML/text templates
- `templates/price_alert.html` - Alert email template
- `templates/daily_summary.html` - Summary email template
- `tests/test_email_system.py` - Email system tests
- `tests/test_chart_generator.py` - Chart generation tests

## Dependencies
- Task 1: Project Setup (for configuration)
- Task 2: Database Schema (for price history data)
- `matplotlib` library
- `smtplib` (built-in)
- `email.mime` (built-in)
- Gmail app password

## Estimated Time
5-7 hours

## Notes
- Use Gmail app passwords, not regular account passwords
- Test email rendering across different clients (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail)
- Keep embedded images under 500KB each for deliverability
- Implement proper error handling for SMTP failures
- Consider email rate limits (Gmail: ~500 emails/day)
- Include unsubscribe options even for personal use

## Chart Specifications
```python
# Chart dimensions and styling
CHART_WIDTH = 800
CHART_HEIGHT = 400
DPI = 150
COLORS = ['#1f77b4', '#ff7f0e', '#2ca02c', '#d62728']
```

## Sample Email Templates

### Price Alert Subject
```
ðŸŽ« Price Drop: {concert_name} - Now ${new_price} (â†“{percentage}%)
```

### Daily Summary Subject
```
ðŸ“Š Daily Price Update - {date} ({num_concerts} concerts tracked)
```

## Sample Usage
```python
# Example usage after implementation
from src.email_client import EmailClient
from src.chart_generator import generate_price_chart

# Send price alert
email_client = EmailClient()
chart_path = generate_price_chart("123456789", days=7)
email_client.send_price_alert("123456789", 200.0, 150.0, chart_path)

# Send daily summary
email_client.send_daily_summary()
```
