# TixScanner Project - User Prompts

## 1. Initial Project Request
> Help me design a specification for an app that allows me to track ticket prices for specific concerts from the ticketmaster API. Specifically, I want to be notified when the resale prices for the concerts I'm tracking are going down. The app should also be able to send a daily summary of ticket prices to my email and with direct links to purchase those tickets. Walk me through the key architectural decisions we need to make, including the preferred programming language, libraries, and platform to develop for. Let's discuss tradeoffs for each approach.

## 2. Project Simplification Request
> Can we simplify this specification with the assumption that I will be the only user? I also prefer using free services/platforms if possible. I also prefer using python whenever possible since that is my preferred language.

## 3. Configuration Method Question
> How I will specify which concerts to track in this specification?

## 4. Configuration Choice
> Let's go with option 1 (config file)

## 5. Feature Enhancement Request
> one more thing - can we include graphs for the ticket prices in the daily emails?

## 6. Documentation Save Request
> Can you save the final specification under /docs/specs.md?

## 7. Best Practices Update Request
> Can we also update CLAUDE.md with best practices for this app?

## 8. Task Breakdown Request
> Can you create individual tasks based off of this specification? Create a separate task file for each task under the docs folder. For each step under a task, the document should contain empty checkboxes to be filled in later. Each task should also have acceptance criteria and implementation steps.

## 9. Conversation Export Request
> Can you export the prompt history for this conversion into a prompts.md file under the docs folder?

## 10. Prompts Simplification Request
> Can you update prompts.md to only include the user requests?
