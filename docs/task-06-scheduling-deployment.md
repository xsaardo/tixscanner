# Task 6: Scheduling and Deployment

## Overview
Implement the main application entry point with scheduling capabilities, integrate all components, and deploy the application to a hosting platform for continuous operation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Main application orchestrates all components correctly

- [ ] Application can run continuously without manual intervention
- [ ] Deployment is successful on chosen platform (GitHub Codespaces/local)
- [ ] Logging and monitoring provide visibility into system operation
- [ ] Application recovers gracefully from failures

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Main Application Structure
- [ ] Create `main.py` as the primary entry point

  - [ ] Resource sharing and cleanup

### 4. Logging and Monitoring System
- [ ] Implement comprehensive logging:
  - [ ] Configure Python logging with appropriate levels
  - [ ] File-based logging with rotation
  - [ ] Console output for development
  - [ ] Structured logging for better analysis
- [ ] Application monitoring:
  - [ ] Health checks for all components

  - [ ] Error tracking and alerting
  - [ ] Resource usage monitoring (memory, CPU)

### 5. Configuration Management
- [ ] Enhanced configuration system:
  - [ ] Configuration validation on startup
  - [ ] Environment-specific configurations
  - [ ] Configuration hot-reloading (optional)
  - [ ] Default configuration generation
- [ ] Setup assistance:
  - [ ] Configuration wizard for first-time setup

  - [ ] Email configuration testing
  - [ ] Database initialization scripts

### 6. Error Handling and Recovery
- [ ] System-wide error handling:
  - [ ] Graceful error recovery for all components
  - [ ] Automatic restart mechanisms
  - [ ] Error notification system
  - [ ] Fallback modes for degraded operation
- [ ] Application resilience:
  - [ ] Circuit breaker pattern for external services
  - [ ] Timeout handling for long-running operations
  - [ ] Resource leak prevention
  - [ ] Clean shutdown procedures

### 7. Deployment Preparation
- [ ] Prepare for deployment:
  - [ ] Create comprehensive requirements.txt
  - [ ] Environment setup documentation
  - [ ] Deployment scripts and instructions
  - [ ] Configuration templates and examples
- [ ] Platform-specific preparation:
  - [ ] GitHub Codespaces configuration
  - [ ] Local machine deployment guide
  - [ ] Docker containerization (optional)
  - [ ] Environment variable management

### 8. Testing and Validation
- [ ] End-to-end testing:
  - [ ] Full application workflow testing
  - [ ] Integration testing across all components
  - [ ] Performance testing under load
  - [ ] Error scenario testing
- [ ] Deployment validation:
  - [ ] Test deployment on target platform
  - [ ] Verify all scheduled jobs run correctly
  - [ ] Validate email delivery in production environment
  - [ ] Monitor system behavior over time

### 9. Production Deployment
- [ ] Deploy to GitHub Codespaces:
  - [ ] Push code to GitHub repository
  - [ ] Configure Codespaces environment
  - [ ] Set up environment variables and secrets
  - [ ] Start application and verify operation
- [ ] Alternative deployments:
  - [ ] Local machine cron job setup
  - [ ] Cloud platform deployment (if chosen)
  - [ ] Container deployment configuration
  - [ ] Process monitoring setup

### 10. Post-Deployment Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor deployed application:
  - [ ] Verify scheduled jobs are running
  - [ ] Check log files for errors
  - [ ] Validate email delivery
  - [ ] Monitor API usage and rate limits
- [ ] Ongoing maintenance:
  - [ ] Log rotation and cleanup
  - [ ] Database maintenance and backups
  - [ ] Performance optimization
  - [ ] Security updates and patches

## Testing Criteria
- [ ] Application starts up without errors
- [ ] All scheduled jobs execute at correct times
- [ ] Price monitoring detects changes and sends alerts
- [ ] Daily summaries are generated and sent
- [ ] System recovers from various failure scenarios
- [ ] Logging provides adequate visibility
- [ ] Deployment platform runs application continuously
- [ ] Resource usage remains within acceptable limits

## Files to Create
- `main.py` - Main application entry point
- `src/scheduler.py` - Scheduling logic and job management
- `src/app_config.py` - Application configuration management
- `deploy/requirements.txt` - Production dependencies
- `deploy/setup.sh` - Deployment setup script
- `deploy/README.md` - Deployment instructions
- `tests/test_integration.py` - End-to-end integration tests

## Dependencies
- All previous tasks (1-5)
- `schedule` library
- Target deployment platform access

## Estimated Time
3-5 hours

## Notes
- Implement graceful shutdown to handle interruption signals
- Use logging instead of print statements for production deployment
- Consider implementing health check endpoints for monitoring
- Document all configuration options clearly
- Test the deployment process thoroughly before going live

## Main Application Structure
```python
# main.py structure overview
def main():
    # 1. Load and validate configuration
    # 2. Initialize logging
    # 3. Initialize database and components
    # 4. Set up scheduled jobs
    # 5. Start monitoring loop
    # 6. Handle shutdown gracefully

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Scheduling Configuration
```ini
[scheduling]
price_check_frequency = "every(2).hours"
daily_summary_time = "09:00"
timezone = "America/New_York"
enable_weekend_checks = true
```

## Deployment Options

### GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)
```bash
# In codespaces terminal
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --mode continuous
```

### Local Machine with Cron
```bash
# Add to crontab
0 */2 * * * cd /path/to/tixscanner && python main.py --mode check
0 9 * * * cd /path/to/tixscanner && python main.py --mode summary
```

## Sample Usage
```python
# Command line usage examples
python main.py                          # Run continuously
python main.py --mode check            # One-time price check
python main.py --mode summary          # Send daily summary
python main.py --mode test             # Test all components
python main.py --config custom.ini     # Use custom config
python main.py --verbose               # Enable debug logging
```

## Production Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Check application status
ps aux | grep main.py

# View recent logs
tail -f logs/tixscanner.log

# Check email delivery logs
grep "Email sent" logs/tixscanner.log | tail -20

# Monitor API usage
grep "API request" logs/tixscanner.log | wc -l
```
